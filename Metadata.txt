Time: is the average of Dec, Jan, Feb
SST: sea Surface Temperature (degree Celsius) is from NOAA/ERSSTv3b (1x1) 181x89 
SLP: sea level pressure (hPa or hecto Pascal) from NCEP Reanalysis 1 (2.5x2.5) 73x144 
TAUX or UFLX: zonal wind stress (Pascal or N/m^2) from NCEP Reanalysis 1 Gaussian Grid 94x192
UWND: zonal wind at 10m (m/s) from NCEP Reanalysis 1 Gaussian Grid 94x192 
VWND: meridional wind at 10m (m/s) from NCEP Reanalysis 1 Gaussian Grid 94x192

The goal is to predict CP or EP for the next year. There may be interest later in predicting for longer, but for now we should focus on the next year.
You can use data from all previous years, but I expect most information comes from just the previous year.
“The index” in my description refers to CP and EP which are indices representing two different types of El Ninos.

Predicting either CP or EP is good.  Predicting both is even better.
CP and EP cannot be calculated from each other.  The reason predicting even one of them is good enough is that being able to predict either at 1-year ahead would be of great benefit, so both would be great, but either would still be useful.
Ideally, I would like to be able to predict the value of the CP and/or EP index, but if we can’t do that or can’t do it well, being able to predict whether cp<-0.5 or cp>0.5? Or similarly: whether ep<-0.5 or ep>0.5 is still useful.
I would not suggest going back more than 2-3 years.
